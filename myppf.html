 <p> Hi my name is Mari Brunnhilde T Bagayas, I am 14 years old and currently studyimh in RTPM- Dumaguete Science Highschool<br>
    I have a lot of hobbies and these are:<br>
painting,drawing,taxidermy,reading,cooking, and writing.<br>
My most unique hobby is taxidermy, a lot of people don't really like the concept of having a dead animal or insect being displayed but for me I think<br> 
that Taxidermy is a really beautiful hobby. Because you are preserving the beauty of one of god's creation, it's just so fascinating to me. How are nature works.</p>
